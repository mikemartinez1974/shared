In fact, I was tickled at the variety and utility I could get with simple request.  And if I can get a node graph out of an AI, can I get one in too?  Oh yes I can, that's not very hard at all.

I've been toying with the idea of building a node graph editor for years, but just as a display vehicle on the web was not enough to justify the effort.  They are too hard to make, and  there's just not enough bang for the buck there.  But now, things are different.  An AI can PRODUCE & CONSUME a node graph, which means any idea you can put into a graph (and the AI will help you do this, if you need it), you can then edit and feed back to the AI and it will just understand, *and* it speaks JSON!  This is enough to justify an app on it's own.  \n\nI know I just made a lot of mental leaps that some people probably do not follow, and I'm sorry.  135, not 105.  Forget the particle effects for a while.  THIS is what I need to be working on!  I suddenly feel like I have a purpose.  Do you see it yet?"

A spreadsheet?  A new paradigm of application will emerge that uses the node graph for structure, your browser for logic, the web as it's hard drive, and your documents are always shareable as links.\n\nThe VR applications will give people reason to host their own servers, either from home or in the cloud, and you'll be able to serve documents from there... it'll be cool.  The document can already hold a web page... that gets kind of crazy in vr... You could have react-based interfaces as wall controls in a scene."

I don't know how to make this easy for a layman to understand, but the whole JSON to web to mind to LLM pipeline that exists right now is a little too good to be true.  I keep trying to explain it, but I just end up sounding like a crazy person, so you'll just have to take my word for it that's its cool.  You guys are worried about programmers...  programmers are going to be President.  But I digress.\n\nBasically, I figure if I can describe a particle effect in JSON, I can get the LLM to produce variations in JSON, which I can then adjust. It will, in theory, do the hard part about making particle effects.  I don't really know anything about particle effects, and I have no idea how to profit from such a thing.  But particle effects are pretty, and my mental health is on the line here, so I start writing."

I think I'm taking the easy route to content creation by \"only\" going after the particles.   Before long I'm realizing that creating the particle system is in fact where all the work is.  Once you can insert a particle effect into a scene, it is *absolutely trivial* to add anything else to that scene.  If you can add a particle emitter, you can add a block.  And at that point, you basically have a full 3d scene creator.  Stick a pin in that.📌"

The documents link together because they live on web.  At this point, the app is no longer a graph editor but instead it's a node browser.  And when you add the 3d/vr, on top of that... a scriptable node network that lives on the web rendered spatially, with content that can be generated by AI.... if I need to explain to you why that is important, then you are not my target audience.  However, I welcome you to my app and I hope you have fun playing with the node graphs.  You can expect improvement in that area.  I'm looking forward to controller-based web browsing.
